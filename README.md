## Instructions

For today's pairing you'll be analyzing the best, worst, and average case complexity of a series of algorithms defined in this assignment. You should work through the functions one by one, making comments and identifying the complexity of each part of the algorithm. If you are unsure of how the algorithms scale, then try adding counter variables and incrementing them each time an operation takes place. By logging out the counters for different sizes of input you should be able to see a trend developing.
